<date class="article__date" datetime="2024-11-17">Published: 17 November 2024</date>
<p><a href="https://github.com/adnanvaldes/task-cli"><code>task-cli</code></a> is the first project I'm working on from <a href="https://roadmap.sh">roadmap.sh</a> as part of their <a href="https://roadmap.sh/backend/projects">Backend Projects</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to write it in JavaScript using Node.js rather than defaulting to my go-to of Python because I wanted to learn how those two work, given how ubiquitous they are.</p>
<p>The major objective here was to get started with JavaScript and NodeJs. While I don't know that my code is quite idiomatic yet, at least I'm feeling more comfortable with the syntax and some of the build-in functionality.</p>
<p>One of the things I was excited to use was <code>switch case</code> statements. In previous Python code, for example, I've used (but tried to avoid!) series of <code>if...else</code> statements:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">switch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">status</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">status</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">"todo"</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">pass</span>
    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">status</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">"mark-in-progress"</span>
        <span class="k">pass</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>[!aside]
As of version 3.10, Python has a "structural pattern matching" feature introduced by <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/">PEP 636</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With JavaScript, I was able to apply similar logic without having a long series of comparison operations:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">taskID</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">==</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">item</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>

<p>One of the interesting things about this is the requirement to have a <code>break</code> statement for each case. Without them, the switch case will still work, but the <code>default</code> case always runs.</p>

<date class="article__date" datetime="2023-01-03">Published: 03 January 2023</date>
<p><quote>He wanted to warn these children that time was not their friend; that though today might seem special, there would be a tomorrow, and a day after that; that the best-case scenario of a well-spent life was the slow and steady unravelling of the heart’s knot.</quote></p>
<p><em>The Vanished Birds</em> is primarily a novel about time and place in a universe worthy of any modern space opera.  The story takes place in a future where advanced technology has allowed humanity to explore and settle other planets, but this progress has also led to the rise of powerful corporations that control and profit from these ventures. Throughout the book, the characters must deal with the effects of this capitalist exploitation, whether it's the harsh working conditions or corporate intrigue. In this way, the book raises important questions about the consequences of unchecked capitalism and the ways it can alienate and exploit individuals.</p>
<p>The beginning of the novel itself consists of a sort of novella (which as I found out after writing most of this review was originally published as a short story before being incorporated into the larger novel) that sets up the universe, where we follow a farmer named Kaeda, who grew up in the backwater planet of Umbai-V.  The story describes Kaeda's life develop from when he was a child all the way until he is an old man, punctuated by the staccato of an offworld cargo ship arriving every 15 years to collect the harvest and carrying the …</p>

<date class="article__date" datetime="2022-12-30">Published: 30 December 2022</date>
<p>As the year comes to a close I have 4.5 servers online, with another that is  yet to be built (mostly due to laziness).</p>
<h3>Trantor</h3>
<p>My primary server, known as Trantor, has been online for just over a year. Until I build my last server, Trantor is the machine around which the rest of my network is built. It's main purpose is to serve files with NFS to my desktop, though it also runs all my other services (see below) inside VMs managed  by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a>. </p>
<p>It is an older set up, that so far has really reinforced in me the idea of giving old hardware a new life. The CPU is a 4th gen Intel that I inherited from a friend who isn't all that much into computers and wanted help upgrading his set up. This is paired with 24 GB RAM and two 4 TB SMR Western Digital Red HDDs.</p>
<h3>Anacreon</h3>
<p>The second server I have is called Anacreon. It's a small Lenovo ThinkCentre with an i5-7500T CPU and also 24 GB RAM. The original idea for this server was to use it for all my VMs and services, leaving Trantor entirely as a file server. However, I decided to upgrade my desktop with a new CPU and a smaller case, which gave me enough spare parts to build a 3rd server. </p>
<p>As a result, Anacreon's job will eventually be to mostly act as an arbiter and another node in a Proxmox High Availability cluster. I probably have …</p>

<date class="article__date" datetime="2022-12-27">Published: 27 December 2022</date>
<h3>Random Intervals</h3>
<p>The first update to the game was to randomise the interval between pipes spawning. </p>
<p>The logic that spawns new pipes lives inside the <code>update</code> function of the game's <code>Play</code> state. It's a fairly simple set-up: if a timer exceeds a preset value, a new pair of pipes is spawned:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">-- in PlayState:update(dt)</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
<span class="kr">if</span> <span class="n">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">timer</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="kr">then</span>
    <span class="c1">-- modify the last Y coordinate we placed so pipe gaps aren't too far apart</span>
    <span class="c1">-- no higher than 10 pixels below the top edge of the screen,</span>
    <span class="c1">-- and no lower than a gap length (90 pixels) from the bottom</span>
    <span class="kd">local</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">math.max</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">PIPE_HEIGHT</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">math.min</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">lastY</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">math.random</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">VIRTUAL_HEIGHT</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">90</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">PIPE_HEIGHT</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="n">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">lastY</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">y</span>

    <span class="c1">-- add a new pipe pair at the end of the screen at our new Y</span>
    <span class="nb">table.insert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">pipePairs</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">PipePair</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">))</span>

    <span class="c1">-- reset timer</span>
    <span class="n">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">timer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="kr">end</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>My first thought was to simply add a call to <code>math.random()</code> as part of the <code>if</code> statement. This was a <em>terrible</em> idea and made the game absolutely cursed - hundreds if not thousands not pipes were being generated and it made the game unplayable. In hindsight this was obvious:  by placing <code>if self.timer &gt; math.random(2,5) then</code> as part of the <code>update</code> loop I was forcing the game to do a check <em>every single frame</em>, and thereby causing pipes to spawn at incredibly high rates.</p>
<p>The solution was quite simple. As part of the game state I initialised a variable called <code>self …</code></p>

<date class="article__date" datetime="2022-12-23">Published: 23 December 2022</date>
<p>The first lecture on <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/">CS50's introduction to game development</a> is about creating a small Pong game using <a href="https://love2d.org/">Love2D</a>.  While the video runs you through the basics of <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> and a step-by -step process of creating a Pong game from scratch, the post-lecture assignment is where things get a bit more interesting.</p>
<p>What I like the most about these projects, though, is the ability to continue extending them as one pleases. I was able to complete the task (in an exceedingly crude manner) of adding computer controlled movement to one of the paddles in about 5 min. But to do it well took much longer (and by well I mean it's acceptable but still horribly jittery!). I also added a few touches that I thought were kinda fun.</p>
<h2>AI Update</h2>
<p>The first problem I tackled was the one directly stated in the project: to create an AI-controlled paddle. Like I said above, my first solution was horrible crude, but <em>technically</em> it worked:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">-- In love.update(dt) function</span>
<span class="n">player2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ball</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">y</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, simply setting the right paddle's <code>y</code> value equal to the ball's is not very interesting (and also makes the game impossible to win). This also doesn't account for the fact that the ball's velocity increases with every bounce, while the paddle's should maintain a constant speed to make the game more challenging.</p>
<p>To solve this, I made ample use of conditionals. The idea is to check whether the ball is above or bellow the paddle and then to …</p>

<date class="article__date" datetime="2022-12-20">Published: 20 December 2022</date>
<p>For 2023, I am looking for more solidity. Something foundational, basic - a framework upon which I can prop up and build other aspects of my life. I suppose that a way to think about it is in the context of goals; far too often I feel like I am wasting time rather than living intentionally, swept up by currents that I often see coming but whose course and final destination I cannot fathom.</p>
<p>Yet in themselves goals cannot possibly achieve this. At best they are milestone markers of events that occurred prior, up to the point when they are complete, and at worst simply reminders of all the things that were <em>not</em> accomplished. My interest here is far more organic, to have something that is growing and always present, not in the future or the past.</p>
<p>Perhaps a different way of thinking about it is in terms of story or narrative. One aspect that attracts me a lot from narrative arcs is that they feel coherent, that there is not wasted breath - think of Chekhov and his gun. There may be specific goals in narrative, but nobody reads fiction because of milestones within the story itself: the narratives are in constant motion.  I understand that life itself is not structured in such a way necessarily, but even an approximation would be well received. </p>

<p><quote>Djinn are a lot like the rest of us,” Fatma said. She plucked a book out of the air that came flying, without stopping her stride. “They just want to know the odd things they’re interested in are appreciated.</quote></p>
<p>I finished reading P. Djèlí Clark's <em>A Master Of Djinn</em> last night. I came across it after scanning the 2021 Nebula Awards.  It's not my usual type of novel - for the most part I look for hard sci-fi space operas with big spaceships and galactic scale events.</p>
<p>I should point out, too, that <em>A Master Of Djinn</em> had big shoes to fill. It won the award, but one of the other nominations was Arkady Martine's <em>A Desolation called Peace</em> which is now one of my favourite books and an absolutely fascinating universe.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise then when I was maybe 30 pages in and immediately hooked and amazed at the world that Clark created. The story line itself is not particularly complex: we follow an investigator who is trying to solve a murder. </p>
<p>But the setting!</p>
<p>The story develops in Cairo in the early 20th century. Around 40 years prior to the events described in the book, a magician called al-Jahiz broke the barrier between this and the magical world. Although initially the world was taken by surprise, the almost half decade since al-Jahiz has made the existence of the djinn fairly routine. They now live, work, and love in the same places as humans do.</p>

<p>One of the main goals I have for this goal is to make it as <strong>friction</strong>-less as possible to write. In an ideal world, I would be able to open my text editor (I use <a href="https://neovim.io/">nvim</a> and <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>), write some content and then, with a single command, publish.</p>
<p>I looked at solutions like <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>, but they are both, well, <em>too much</em>. Or rather, they are designed, as per Ghost's tagline, for "the creator economy". That is, they include analytics, membership, revenue charts, etc. etc. I want none of that.</p>
<p>I just want a static page with a bunch of html. Zero bells and whistles.</p>
<p>So the next option was to either build something with a static site generator like <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> (which is what I'm using now!) or host the blog on a site like <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a> or <a href="https://writefreely.org/">Writefreely</a>. The latter two are pretty cool, too! Bear Blog is the essence of simplicity (and part of the inspiration for the design of this blog), while Writefreely's integration with the Fediverse is awesome. Unfortunately, the design is pretty set in stone, hosting images is more difficult, and to publish one has to place their text on a browser.</p>

<date class="article__date" datetime="2022-08-28">Published: 28 August 2022</date>
<p>Until recently, I have been consuming RSS feeds by way of a self-hosted <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> instance that delivers them to my phone. The problem is that using a mobile platform invariably leads to a more shallow reading experience - when scrolling through a large set of feeds it starts to feel more like a news aggregator site like Reddit and less like a curated feed (though I suppose it doesn't help that I subscribe to the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>). I am far less likely to take notes or really remember what I read, and instead browsing these feeds turned into a time wasting activity more than anything. </p>
<p>To combat this, I started subscribing to more and more individual blogs and long form journalism sites, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/the-long-read">The Guardian Long Read</a> and <a href="https://longreads.com">Longreads</a>. I enjoy the format a lot more and it helps my feeds populate with non-technology commentary. What I don't like is mobile screens and computer monitors: I find these screens exhausting when trying to read for long periods of time, they have glare and, worse, they are incredibly distracting.</p>
<p>The solution, of course, is to use an e-reader.</p>
<p>The end goal of this little project was to have remote access to long form RSS feeds on my kindle without adding too much friction. To work within these constraints I could not rely on manual updates or on connecting my kindle to my desktop. I just wanted the feeds to <em>magically</em> appear on my kindle's library, ready to be …</p>

<p>I am very keen on the idea of a decentralised web, insofar as that is possible (centralisation due to ISPs, data centres, DNS servers, etc. notwithstanding), and while I love the <em>idea</em> of 100% peer-to-peer communication, I don't believe it is a feasible way to organise the web. I don't really have the technical expertise to argue the details of crypto/blockchain-based internets, but from what I see regularly on Hacker News I am certainly not a proponent of those technologies for this particular issue.</p>
<p>I should point out that this isn't entirely about privacy - though I do care about being able to maintain the privacy of internet users - nor is it entirely about P2P protocols - but I do think those are pretty cool! Rather, what I want to see is a way to enable access to an internet that has personality instead of branding, that is organic instead of defined by market studies and A/B testing.</p>
<p>Given how much technology is in our lives now, how defined by it we have become, I suspect we would all be better off being at least somewhat familiar with the workings of the internet; in particular, with how we are able to express ourselves on this medium without explicit reliance on third-party controls. What I mean by this is depending on TikTok, Google, Microsoft, etc. for access to the largest communication network in existence seems like a poor choice.</p>

<p>I love text adventure games. I am not very good at them, but I very much enjoy the world building and interactive aspect of text-based terminal games, in much the same way that I love tabletop RPGs like <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> or <em>Stars Without Number</em>.</p>
<p>Text adventures are also excellent candidates for in-flight entertainment on long-haul routes.
