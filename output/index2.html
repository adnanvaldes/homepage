<date class="article__date" datetime="2022-11-27">Published: 27 November 2022</date>
<p><quote>Djinn are a lot like the rest of us,” Fatma said. She plucked a book out of the air that came flying, without stopping her stride. “They just want to know the odd things they’re interested in are appreciated.</quote></p>
<p>I finished reading P. Djèlí Clark's <em>A Master Of Djinn</em> last night. I came across it after scanning the 2021 Nebula Awards.  It's not my usual type of novel - for the most part I look for hard sci-fi space operas with big spaceships and galactic scale events.</p>
<p>I should point out, too, that <em>A Master Of Djinn</em> had big shoes to fill. It won the award, but one of the other nominations was Arkady Martine's <em>A Desolation called Peace</em> which is now one of my favourite books and an absolutely fascinating universe.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise then when I was maybe 30 pages in and immediately hooked and amazed at the world that Clark created. The story line itself is not particularly complex: we follow an investigator who is trying to solve a murder. </p>
<p>But the setting!</p>
<p>The story develops in Cairo in the early 20th century. Around 40 years prior to the events described in the book, a magician called al-Jahiz broke the barrier between this and the magical world. Although initially the world was taken by surprise, the almost half decade since al-Jahiz has made the existence of the djinn fairly routine. They now live, work, and love in the same places as humans do.</p>

<date class="article__date" datetime="2022-11-26">Published: 26 November 2022</date>
<p>One of the main goals I have for this goal is to make it as <strong>friction</strong>-less as possible to write. In an ideal world, I would be able to open my text editor (I use <a href="https://neovim.io/">nvim</a> and <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>), write some content and then, with a single command, publish.</p>
<p>I looked at solutions like <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>, but they are both, well, <em>too much</em>. Or rather, they are designed, as per Ghost's tagline, for "the creator economy". That is, they include analytics, membership, revenue charts, etc. etc. I want none of that.</p>
<p>I just want a static page with a bunch of html. Zero bells and whistles.</p>
<p>So the next option was to either build something with a static site generator like <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> (which is what I'm using now!) or host the blog on a site like <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a> or <a href="https://writefreely.org/">Writefreely</a>. The latter two are pretty cool, too! Bear Blog is the essence of simplicity (and part of the inspiration for the design of this blog), while Writefreely's integration with the Fediverse is awesome. Unfortunately, the design is pretty set in stone, hosting images is more difficult, and to publish one has to place their text on a browser.</p>
<p>For context, the way this blog was deployed before was through Cloudflare Pages. The html and css files are generated on my computer and then I had to manually upload a folder with all the html to the project page. Far too tedious, in my opinion.</p>

<h2 class="article__h2"><a href="/202208181152.html">[ Consuming feeds ]</a></h2>
<date class="article__date" datetime="2022-08-28">Published: 28 August 2022</date>
<p>Until recently, I have been consuming RSS feeds by way of a self-hosted <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> instance that delivers them to my phone. The problem is that using a mobile platform invariably leads to a more shallow reading experience - when scrolling through a large set of feeds it starts to feel more like a news aggregator site like Reddit and less like a curated feed (though I suppose it doesn't help that I subscribe to the front page of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>). I am far less likely to take notes or really remember what I read, and instead browsing these feeds turned into a time wasting activity more than anything. </p>
<p>To combat this, I started subscribing to more and more individual blogs and long form journalism sites, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/the-long-read">The Guardian Long Read</a> and <a href="https://longreads.com">Longreads</a>. I enjoy the format a lot more and it helps my feeds populate with non-technology commentary. What I don't like is mobile screens and computer monitors: I find these screens exhausting when trying to read for long periods of time, they have glare and, worse, they are incredibly distracting.</p>
<p>The solution, of course, is to use an e-reader.</p>
<p>The end goal of this little project was to have remote access to long form RSS feeds on my kindle without adding too much friction. To work within these constraints I could not rely on manual updates or on connecting my kindle to my desktop. I just wanted the feeds to <em>magically</em> appear on my kindle's library, ready to be …</p>

<h2 class="article__h2"><a href="/20220706.html">[ The personal web ]</a></h2>
<date class="article__date" datetime="2022-07-06">Published: 06 July 2022</date>
<p>I am very keen on the idea of a decentralised web, insofar as that is possible (centralisation due to ISPs, data centres, DNS servers, etc. notwithstanding), and while I love the <em>idea</em> of 100% peer-to-peer communication, I don't believe it is a feasible way to organise the web. I don't really have the technical expertise to argue the details of crypto/blockchain-based internets, but from what I see regularly on Hacker News I am certainly not a proponent of those technologies for this particular issue.</p>
<p>I should point out that this isn't entirely about privacy - though I do care about being able to maintain the privacy of internet users - nor is it entirely about P2P protocols - but I do think those are pretty cool! Rather, what I want to see is a way to enable access to an internet that has personality instead of branding, that is organic instead of defined by market studies and A/B testing.</p>
<p>Given how much technology is in our lives now, how defined by it we have become, I suspect we would all be better off being at least somewhat familiar with the workings of the internet; in particular, with how we are able to express ourselves on this medium without explicit reliance on third-party controls. What I mean by this is depending on TikTok, Google, Microsoft, etc. for access to the largest communication network in existence seems like a poor choice.</p>
<p>Not that I would like to propose we all become experts in …</p>
