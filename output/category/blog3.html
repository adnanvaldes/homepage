<h2>Installing Win10 on old hardware</h2>
<p>Originally Win 7 Pro installed on two WD Blue HDDs. Target set up: Windows 10 on a WD Blue 500G SSD to speed up boot times.</p>
<p>Problems encountered: old motherboard, no driver support, "missing media drivers", "no OS found" after install.</p>
<p>Solution: Install Windows 10 on SSD via a different motherboard and configure. Then plug SSD to old computer</p>
<h2>Setting up X-Plane</h2>
<p>X-Plane 11 installation was straightforward. NVIDIA drivers needed to be updated: GeForce GTX 750 Ti installed with drivers version 4xx. Update to 512.15.</p>
<p>X-Plane appears to work and boots well. However, there is concern over COM port usability for hardware flight controls. Install PFC drivers; need to compare FSUIPC and XUIPC -&gt; specifically, check if the later depends on the former, and whether it is required. Nonetheless, download all DLL as a precaution.</p>
<p>Hardware was working before, so plug in old HDDs and browse for relevant files. Copy Custom Maps into X-Plane, copy PFCTest software to manage COM port. Suspect ignition issue at hardware level related to this or mismatch of hardware inputs and <code>datarefs</code> assignment.</p>
<h3>Testing network communication</h3>
<p>Install X-Plane 11 on Arch Linux to set up instructor station. Concerns: OS incompatibility.</p>
<h3>Running on Linux</h3>
<p>Installer fails due to missing <code>libGLU.so.1</code>. Name is apparently outdated, and often just a symlink for <code>glu</code>. To install, <code>yay -S glu</code>; after a .14 MiB download, X-Plane installer runs.</p>

<p>I love text adventure games. I am not very good at them, but I very much enjoy the world building and interactive aspect of text-based terminal games, in much the same way that I love tabletop RPGs like <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> or <em>Stars Without Number</em>.</p>
<p>Text adventures are also excellent candidates for in-flight entertainment on long-haul routes. I recently travelled to Delhi from Vancouver, on a flight that was scheduled 3 days after the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Because of the closure of Russian airspace to most airlines, my route was YVR -&gt; YYZ (3 hour stop) YYZ -&gt; Delhi. In other words, the ETE changed from about 13 hours to just over 22 hours.</p>
<p>To set up, I bought the Zork Anthology through Steam. I know Infocom has made Zork 1 - 3 <a href="http://www.infocom-if.org/downloads/downloads.html">available for free</a>, but because this was a fairly late schedule change I decided to go the easy way and shell out $8.00 for the whole set.</p>
<p>The games themselves work well, but I had a few problems with the set-up. To start with, I have Manjaro installed on all my computers, but the Zork Anthology only has a Windows release on Steam. Not much of an issue in itself: I regularly use Proton to play on Linux and I have had very few problems. However, the thought of running Proton to <em>then</em> run a DOS emulator to play Zork rubbed me the wrong way.</p>
<p>The other option I've seen is to play Zork through …</p>
