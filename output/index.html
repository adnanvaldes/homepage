<p><quote>He wanted to warn these children that time was not their friend; that though today might seem special, there would be a tomorrow, and a day after that; that the best-case scenario of a well-spent life was the slow and steady unravelling of the heart’s knot.</quote></p>
<p><em>The Vanished Birds</em> is primarily a novel about time and place in a universe worthy of any modern space opera.  The story takes place in a future where advanced technology has allowed humanity to explore and settle other planets, but this progress has also led to the rise of powerful corporations that control and profit from these ventures. Throughout the book, the characters must deal with the effects of this capitalist exploitation, whether it's the harsh working conditions or corporate intrigue. In this way, the book raises important questions about the consequences of unchecked capitalism and the ways it can alienate and exploit individuals.</p>
<p>The beginning of the novel itself consists of a sort of novella (which as I found out after writing most of this review was originally published as a short story before being incorporated into the larger novel) that sets up the universe, where we follow a farmer named Kaeda, who grew up in the backwater planet of Umbai-V.  The story describes Kaeda's life develop from when he was a child all the way until he is an old man, punctuated by the staccato of an offworld cargo ship arriving every 15 years to collect the harvest and carrying the …</p>

<date class="article__date" datetime="2022-12-30">Published: 30 December 2022</date>
<p>As the year comes to a close I have 4.5 servers online, with another that is  yet to be built (mostly due to laziness).</p>
<h3>Trantor</h3>
<p>My primary server, known as Trantor, has been online for just over a year. Until I build my last server, Trantor is the machine around which the rest of my network is built. It's main purpose is to serve files with NFS to my desktop, though it also runs all my other services (see below) inside VMs managed  by <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a>. </p>
<p>It is an older set up, that so far has really reinforced in me the idea of giving old hardware a new life. The CPU is a 4th gen Intel that I inherited from a friend who isn't all that much into computers and wanted help upgrading his set up. This is paired with 24 GB RAM and two 4 TB SMR Western Digital Red HDDs.</p>
<h3>Anacreon</h3>
<p>The second server I have is called Anacreon. It's a small Lenovo ThinkCentre with an i5-7500T CPU and also 24 GB RAM. The original idea for this server was to use it for all my VMs and services, leaving Trantor entirely as a file server. However, I decided to upgrade my desktop with a new CPU and a smaller case, which gave me enough spare parts to build a 3rd server. </p>
<p>As a result, Anacreon's job will eventually be to mostly act as an arbiter and another node in a Proxmox High Availability cluster. I probably have …</p>

<date class="article__date" datetime="2022-12-27">Published: 27 December 2022</date>
<h3>Random Intervals</h3>
<p>The first update to the game was to randomise the interval between pipes spawning. </p>
<p>The logic that spawns new pipes lives inside the <code>update</code> function of the game's <code>Play</code> state. It's a fairly simple set-up: if a timer exceeds a preset value, a new pair of pipes is spawned:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">-- in PlayState:update(dt)</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
<span class="kr">if</span> <span class="n">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">timer</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="kr">then</span>
    <span class="c1">-- modify the last Y coordinate we placed so pipe gaps aren't too far apart</span>
    <span class="c1">-- no higher than 10 pixels below the top edge of the screen,</span>
    <span class="c1">-- and no lower than a gap length (90 pixels) from the bottom</span>
    <span class="kd">local</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">math.max</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">PIPE_HEIGHT</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">math.min</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">lastY</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">math.random</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">VIRTUAL_HEIGHT</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">90</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">PIPE_HEIGHT</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="n">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">lastY</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">y</span>

    <span class="c1">-- add a new pipe pair at the end of the screen at our new Y</span>
    <span class="nb">table.insert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">pipePairs</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">PipePair</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">))</span>

    <span class="c1">-- reset timer</span>
    <span class="n">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">timer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="kr">end</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>My first thought was to simply add a call to <code>math.random()</code> as part of the <code>if</code> statement. This was a <em>terrible</em> idea and made the game absolutely cursed - hundreds if not thousands not pipes were being generated and it made the game unplayable. In hindsight this was obvious:  by placing <code>if self.timer &gt; math.random(2,5) then</code> as part of the <code>update</code> loop I was forcing the game to do a check <em>every single frame</em>, and thereby causing pipes to spawn at incredibly high rates.</p>
<p>The solution was quite simple. As part of the game state I initialised a variable called <code>self …</code></p>

<h2 class="article__h2"><a href="/202212231346.html">[ Pong - The AI Update ]</a></h2>
<date class="article__date" datetime="2022-12-23">Published: 23 December 2022</date>
<p>The first lecture on <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/">CS50's introduction to game development</a> is about creating a small Pong game using <a href="https://love2d.org/">Love2D</a>.  While the video runs you through the basics of <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> and a step-by -step process of creating a Pong game from scratch, the post-lecture assignment is where things get a bit more interesting.</p>
<p>What I like the most about these projects, though, is the ability to continue extending them as one pleases. I was able to complete the task (in an exceedingly crude manner) of adding computer controlled movement to one of the paddles in about 5 min. But to do it well took much longer (and by well I mean it's acceptable but still horribly jittery!). I also added a few touches that I thought were kinda fun.</p>
<h2>AI Update</h2>
<p>The first problem I tackled was the one directly stated in the project: to create an AI-controlled paddle. Like I said above, my first solution was horrible crude, but <em>technically</em> it worked:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">-- In love.update(dt) function</span>
<span class="n">player2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ball</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">y</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, simply setting the right paddle's <code>y</code> value equal to the ball's is not very interesting (and also makes the game impossible to win). This also doesn't account for the fact that the ball's velocity increases with every bounce, while the paddle's should maintain a constant speed to make the game more challenging.</p>
<p>To solve this, I made ample use of conditionals. The idea is to check whether the ball is above or bellow the paddle and then to …</p>

<date class="article__date" datetime="2022-12-20">Published: 20 December 2022</date>
<p>For 2023, I am looking for more solidity. Something foundational, basic - a framework upon which I can prop up and build other aspects of my life. I suppose that a way to think about it is in the context of goals; far too often I feel like I am wasting time rather than living intentionally, swept up by currents that I often see coming but whose course and final destination I cannot fathom.</p>
<p>Yet in themselves goals cannot possibly achieve this. At best they are milestone markers of events that occurred prior, up to the point when they are complete, and at worst simply reminders of all the things that were <em>not</em> accomplished. My interest here is far more organic, to have something that is growing and always present, not in the future or the past.</p>
<p>Perhaps a different way of thinking about it is in terms of story or narrative. One aspect that attracts me a lot from narrative arcs is that they feel coherent, that there is not wasted breath - think of Chekhov and his gun. There may be specific goals in narrative, but nobody reads fiction because of milestones within the story itself: the narratives are in constant motion.  I understand that life itself is not structured in such a way necessarily, but even an approximation would be well received. </p>
<p>I know I have been yearning for this for a little while now. In 2022 I experienced a slow drop-off from open world RPG games. For instance …</p>
