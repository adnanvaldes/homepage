    <p><strong>He wanted to warn these children that time was not their friend; that though today might seem special, there would be a tomorrow, and a day after that; that the best-case scenario of a well-spent life was the slow and steady unravelling of the heart’s knot.</strong> - <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/45422268-the-vanished-birds"><em>The Vanished Birds …</em></a></p>

    <span class="main__article-date">30 December 2022</span>
    <p>As the year comes to a close I have 4.5 servers online, with another that is  yet to be built (mostly due to laziness).</p>
<h3>Trantor</h3>
<p>My primary server, known as Trantor, has been online for just over a year. Until I build my last server, Trantor is the machine …</p>

    <span class="main__article-date">27 December 2022</span>
    <h3>Random Intervals</h3>
<p>The first update to the game was to randomise the interval between pipes spawning. </p>
<p>The logic that spawns new pipes lives inside the <code>update</code> function of the game's <code>Play</code> state. It's a fairly simple set-up: if a timer exceeds a preset value, a new pair of pipes is …</p>

    <p>The first lecture on <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/">CS50's introduction to game development</a> is about creating a small Pong game using <a href="https://love2d.org/">Love2D</a>.  While the video runs you through the basics of <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> and a step-by -step process of creating a Pong game from scratch, the post-lecture assignment is where things get a bit more …</p>

    <span class="main__article-date">20 December 2022</span>
    <p>For 2023, I am looking for more solidity. Something foundational, basic - a framework upon which I can prop up and build other aspects of my life. I suppose that a way to think about it is in the context of goals; far too often I feel like I am wasting …</p>

    <span class="main__article-date">26 November 2022</span>
    <p>One of the main goals I have for this goal is to make it as <strong>friction</strong>-less as possible to write. In an ideal world, I would be able to open my text editor (I use <a href="https://neovim.io/">nvim</a> and <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>), write some content and then, with a single command, publish.</p>

    <span class="main__article-date">28 August 2022</span>
    <p>Until recently, I have been consuming RSS feeds by way of a self-hosted <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> instance that delivers them to my phone. The problem is that using a mobile platform invariably leads to a more shallow reading experience - when scrolling through a large set of feeds it starts to feel more …</p>

    <span class="main__article-date">06 July 2022</span>
    <p>I am very keen on the idea of a decentralised web, insofar as that is possible (centralisation due to ISPs, data centres, DNS servers, etc. notwithstanding), and while I love the <em>idea</em> of 100% peer-to-peer communication, I don't believe it is a feasible way to organise the web. I don't …</p>
